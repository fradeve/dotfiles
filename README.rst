fradeve's dotfiles
==================

This repo has been structured to be used with GNU Stow.
The following software is _dotfiled_ in this repo:

* Xinitrc
* i3 wm
* (oh-my-)zsh
* konsole (with dircolors-solarized_)
* latexmk
* mpd
* mutt
* newsbeuter

* powerline_
* vim
* git
* customizepkg, in a separate dir from `home`
* vagrant dotfiles
* fabric.py
* Beets_
* TaskWarrior

When program's settings depend from another software, or when installation is quite complicated, an `INSTALL` file is provided. When a program needs some passwords in the rc file, an `example` folder has been added with some samples of rc files.
